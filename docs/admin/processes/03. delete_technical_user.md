## External dependencies

The process worker communicates with the SAP DIM to delete the technical user. It further more communicates with the portal backend to return the status of the deletion.

## Process Steps

### DELETE_TECHNICAL_USER

The process step `DELETE_TECHNICAL_USER` is automatically triggered from the process worker. It sends a request to delete the technical user from the SAP DIM.

### SEND_TECHNICAL_USER_DELETION_CALLBACK

The process step `SEND_TECHNICAL_USER_DELETION_CALLBACK` is automatically triggered from the process worker. It deletes the technical user from the DIM database and sends a status update to the portal backend.
